3. What are the possible reasons for the following defect? How would you go about
debugging the problem and gathering more information?

On a web application, a user adds a phone number to their account. The user
then changes the phone number. Upon trying to re-enter the first phone number,
the user is allowed to click Save, and it seems to work, but the saved number
remains the second number rather than updating to the more recently entered
number. A page refresh does not change the result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fact that "it seems to work" tells me that the UI is responding as expected to the
user's actions. The user entered a phone number, and changed it successfully, meaning the
new phone number entered by the user was written to the database and the new value was
rendered successfully. This defect is occurring specifically with a number that has existed
on the users account.

I would debug the issue by recreating the scenario and observing the request from UI to determine
where the defect is occurring. If the UI request has the correct phone number, then the issue
is occurring from the database. Perhaps there is a record saved of previous phone numbers on
each account, and the defect is caused by only writing to the database if the phone number is
unique to the account. If the UI request does not have the correct phone number, then the issue
is occurring from the UI. Perhaps there is a defect in the validation of the phone number, that
fails if the number was previously entered however the failure is not shown to the user and the
previous number persists.
